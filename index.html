<h2>Recent Projects</h2>
<p>Investigation of the feasibility of producing an MVC website that could query Exchange 2010 Calendars to produce an at a glance view of where in the country staff were.
This project was only looking at how well such a system would work and to improve my skills in the MVC area and as such has not been used in production.
I built a command line Tool for updating the SQL backend database using Exchange Web Services API, SSDT database project for storing the information, MVC website which included using Entity Framework for the data layer and Azure AD for Authorization.</p>
 
<p>Clouds UK SaaS website (www.cloudsuk.com)<br/>
ASP.NET WebForms website using SSDT database projects, and a Core Shared Library project.
My recent work on this website include creating a data extractor for downloading all files uploaded for a specific client, amending what information is displayed in certain reports and many other bug fixes.</p>
 
<p>Upgraded a Web Service<br/>
We have a SOAP web service which an external website queries to pull back data. Following a change with their website I was asked to update the web service. I performed the following, created a new Stored Procedure to bring back the required data as specified by the external site and added a new method in the web service. </p>
